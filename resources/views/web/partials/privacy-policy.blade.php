<h3>Zero Usage Information</h3>

<br />

<p>This is information about which courses, groups, people, features, content, and links you interact with within Zero and what integrations with related services you use.</p>

<br />

<h3>How we use your information</h3>

<br />

<p>We use your information for the following:</p>

<br />

<h3>Understanding and improving our products</h3>

<br />

<p>To make the product better, we have to understand how users are using it. We have a fair bit of data about usage and we intend to use it in different ways to improve our products, including research. This policy is not intended to place any limits on what we do with usage data that is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer tied to a Zero user.</p>

<br />

<h3>Investigating and preventing bad stuff from happening.</h3>

<br />

<p>We work hard to keep Zero secure and to prevent abuse and fraud.</p>

<br />

<h3>Communicating with you</h3>

<br />

<h4>- Solving your problems and responding to your requests</h4>

<br />

<p>If you contact us with a problem or a question, we will use your contact information to respond to that request and address your problems or concerns.</p>

<br />
<h4> - Email messages </h4></p>

<br />

<p>We may contact you to inform you about changes in our services, our service offerings and important service related notices, such as changes to this policy or security and fraud notices. These messages are considered as a part of the service and you may not opt-out of them. In addition, we sometimes send emails to Zero users about new product features or other news about Zero. You can opt-out of these at any time.</p>

<br />

<br />

<h3>Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

<br />

<h3>About you with your organisation or Institute Administrator(s)</h3>

<br />

<p>There may be times when you contact Zero to help resolve an issue specific to a group you are a member of. In order to help resolve the issue, we may need to share your concern with your institute administrator. When possible, we will try to mask or remove any identifying information before sharing these communications.</p>

<br />

<h3>With third party service providers</h3>

<br />

<p>We may employ third party companies or individuals to process personal information on our behalf, based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. For example, we may share data with a security consultant to help us get better at preventing unauthorised access or with an email vendor to send messages on our behalf. We may also share data with hosting providers and other consultants who work on our behalf.</p>

<p><a name="page3"></a> <strong>Security</strong>

<br />

<p>Zero takes reasonable steps to protect information you provide to us as a part of your use of the Zero service from loss, misuse, and unauthorised access or disclosure. These steps take into account the sensitivity of the information we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.</p>

<br />

<p>When you enter sensitive information (such as sign-in credentials) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no electronic or email transmission or digital storage mechanism is ever fully secure or error free.</p>

<br />

<p>If you believe you have found a security vulnerability on Zero, please <a href="mailto:security@zero.institute">let us know </a>right away. We will investigate all reports and do our best to quickly fix valid issues.</p>

<br />

<h3>Children’s information</h3>

<br />

<p>Zero is not directed to children under 13. If you learn that a minor child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please <a href="mailto:security@zero.institute">contact us</a>.</p>

<br />

<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>

<br />

<p>We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do, we’ll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use Zero after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy. If the changes are material, we may provide more prominent notice or seek your consent to the new policy.</p>
