<h1>Institute Admin Terms</h1>

<p><br />
</p>

<p class="small text-muted">Effective: >Monday, 13 March y </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>These Institute Admin Terms of Service (the “Institute Admin Terms”) describe your rights and responsibilities when using our online workplace productivity tools and platform (the “Services”). Please read them carefully. If you are Institute Admin (defined below), these Institute Admin Terms govern your access and use of our Services. If you are being invited to an institute workplace set up by Institute admin, the User Terms of Service (the “User Terms” ) govern your access and use of the Services. We are grateful you’re here.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>These “Institute Admin Terms” Form a Part of a Binding “Contract”</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>These Institute Admin Terms (or, if applicable, your written agreement with us) and any Order Form(s) (defined below) together form a binding “Contract” between Institute Admin and us. “We,” “our” and “us” currently refer to Scalex Systems Pvt. Ltd.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Your Agreement On Behalf of “Institute Admin”</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>If you purchase subscription(s), create an institute account (i.e. a unique institute workplace where a group of students, teachers and non-teaching employees may access the Services), invite users to that institute workplace, or use or allow use of that institute workplace after being notified of a change to these Institute Admin Terms, you acknowledge your understanding of the then-current Contract and agree to the Contract on behalf of Institute Admin. Please make sure you have the necessary authority to enter into the Contract on behalf of Institute Admin before proceeding.</p>

<h2 lang="en-US" align="left">Institute Admin Choices and Instructions</h2>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Who is “Institute Admin”?</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>“Institute Admin” is the institute that you represent in agreeing to the Contract.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Signing Up</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>If you signed up for a plan using your institute email domain, your education institute is Institute admin, and Institute Admin can modify and re-assign roles (including your role) and otherwise exercise its rights under the Contract. If Institute elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority, we will provide you with notice following such election and you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or Institute to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the institute.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>What This Means for Institute Admin—and for Us</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Individuals (students, teachers and non-teaching employees) authorised by Institute Admin to access the Services (an “Authorised User”) may submit content or information to the Services, such as records, messages or files (“Institute Data”), and Institute Admin may exclusively provide us with instructions on what to do with it. For example, Institute Admin may provision or deprovision access to the Services, enable or disable third party integrations, manage permissions, retention and export settings, transfer or assign institute account, share courses, or consolidate institute account or institute courses with other institute account or courses.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Institute Admin will (a) inform Authorised Users of all Institute Admin policies and practices that are relevant to their use of the Services and of any settings that may impact the processing of Institute Admin Data; and (b) obtain all rights, permissions or consents from Authorised Users and other Institute Admin personnel that are necessary to grant the rights and licenses in the Contract and for the lawful use and transmission of Institute Admin Data and the operation of the Services.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Ordering Subscriptions</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>A subscription allows an Authorised User to access the Services. No matter the role, a subscription is required for each Authorised User. A subscription may be procured through the Services interface, or in some cases, via an order form entered into between Institute Admin and us (each, an “Order Form”). Each Authorised User must agree to the User Terms to activate their subscription. Subscriptions commence when we make them available to Institute Admin and continue for the term specified in the Services “check-out” interface or in the Order Form, as applicable. Each subscription is for a single Authorised User for a specified term and is personal to that Authorised User. During an active subscription term, adding more subscriptions is fairly easy. Unless the Order Form says otherwise, Institute Admin may purchase more subscriptions at the same price stated in the Order Form and all will terminate on the same date.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Purchasing Decisions</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>We may share information about our future product plans because we like transparency. Our public statements about those product plans are an expression of intent, but do not rely on them when making a purchase. If Institute Admin decides to buy our Services, that decision should be based on the functionality or features we have made available today and not on the delivery of any future functionality or features.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Feedback is Welcome</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>The more suggestions our users make, the better the Services become. If Institute Admin sends us any feedback or suggestions regarding the Services, there is a chance we will use it, so Institute Admin grants us (for itself and all of its Authorised Users and other Institute Admin personnel) an unlimited, irrevocable, perpetual, sub-licensable, transferable, royalty-free license to use any such feedback or suggestions for any purpose without any obligation or compensation to Institute Admin, any Authorised User or other Institute Admin personnel. If we choose not to implement the suggestion, please don’t take it personally. We appreciate it nonetheless.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Please review our Privacy Policy for more information on how we collect and use data relating to the use and performance of our websites and products.</p>

</h2>

<h2 lang="en-US" align="left">Institute Admin and Authorised Users</h2>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Use of the Services</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Institute Admin must comply with the Contract and ensure that its Authorised Users comply with the Contract and the User Terms. We may review conduct for compliance purposes, but we have no obligation to do so. We aren't responsible for the content of any Institute Admin Data or the way Institute Admin or its Authorised Users choose to use the Services to store or process any Institute Admin Data. The Services are not intended for and should not be used by anyone under the age of 13. Institute Admin must ensure that all Authorised Users are over 13 years old. Institute Admin is solely responsible for providing high speed internet service for itself and its Authorised Users to access and use the Services.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Our Removal Rights</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>If we believe that there is a violation of the Contract that can simply be remedied by Institute Admin’s removal of certain Institute Admin Data, we will, in most cases, ask Institute Admin to take direct action rather than intervene. However, we may directly step in and take what we determine to be appropriate action, if Institute Admin does not take appropriate action, or if we believe there is a credible risk of harm to us, the Services, Authorised Users, or any third parties.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

</h2>

<h2 lang="en-US" align="left">Payment Obligations</h2>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Payment Terms</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>For Institute Admin that purchase our Services, fees are specified at the Services interface “Pricing” and in the Order Form(s) — and must be paid in advance. Payment obligations are non-cancelable and, except as expressly stated in the Contract, fees paid are non-refundable. If we agree to invoice Institute Admin by email, full payment must be received within ten (10) days from the invoice date. Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”). Institute Admin will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases, except for those taxes based on our net income.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Downgrade for Non-Payment</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>If any fees owed to us by Institute Admin (excluding amounts disputed reasonably and in good faith) are ten (10) days or more overdue, we may, without limiting our other rights and remedies, downgrade any fee-based Services to free plans until those amounts are paid in full, so long as we have given Institute Admin ten (10) or more days’ prior notice that its account is overdue. Not withstanding the second paragraph of the “Providing the Services” section below, Institute Admin acknowledges and agrees that a downgrade will result in a decrease in certain features and functionality and potential loss of access to Institute Admin Data, as illustrated by comparing the plans in the Pricing Guide.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h2 lang="en-US" align="left">Our Responsibilities</h2>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Providing the Services</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Institute Admin isn’t the only one with responsibilities; we have some, too. We will (a) make the Services available to Institute Admin and its Authorised Users as described in the Contract; and (b) not use or process Institute Admin Data for any purpose without Institute Admin’s prior instructions; provided, however, that “prior instructions” will be deemed to include use of the Services by Authorised Users and any processing related to such use or otherwise necessary for the performance of the Contract.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Be assured that (a) the Services will perform materially in accordance with our then-current Help Centre pages; and (b) subject to “Downgrade for Non-Payment” sections , we will not materially decrease the functionality of a Service during a subscription term. For any breach of a warranty in this section, Institute Admin’s exclusive remedies are those described in the sections titled “Termination for Cause” and “Effect of Termination”.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Keeping the Services Available</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Further, for some of our Services, we also offer specific uptime commitments paired with credits, if we fall short. In those cases, the credits will serve as what the lawyers call liquidated damages and will be Institute Admin’s sole remedy for the downtime and related inconvenience. For all Service plans, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Services available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, excluding planned downtime. We expect planned downtime to be infrequent but will endeavour to provide Institute Admin with advance notice (e.g., through the Services), if we think it may exceed five (5) continuous minutes.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Protecting Institute Admin Data</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>The protection of Institute Admin Data is a top priority for us so we will maintain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards at a level not materially less protective than as described in our Security Practices page. Those safeguards will include measures for preventing unauthorised access, use, modification, deletion and disclosure of Institute Admin Data by our personnel. Before sharing Institute Admin Data with any of our third party service providers, we will ensure that the third party maintains, at a minimum, reasonable data practices for maintaining the confidentiality and security of Institute Admin Data and preventing unauthorised access. Institute Admin (not us) bears sole responsibility for adequate security, protection and backup of Institute Admin Data when in Institute Admin’s or its representatives’ or agents’ possession or control or when Institute Admin chooses to use unencrypted gateways (e.g., IRC/XMPP clients) to connect to the Services. We are not responsible for what Institute Admin’s Authorised Users do with Institute Admin Data. That is Institute Admin’s responsibility.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>The Scalex Extended Family</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>We may leverage our employees, those of our corporate affiliates and third party contractors (the “Scalex Extended Family”) in exercising our rights and performing our obligations under the Contract. We will be responsible for the Scalex Extended Family’s compliance with our obligations under the Contract.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h2 lang="en-US" align="left">Ownership and Proprietary Rights</h2>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>What’s Yours is Yours...</h3>

<p>As between us on one hand, and Institute Admin and any Authorised Users on the other, Institute Admin will own all Institute Admin Data. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Contract, Institute Admin (for itself and all of its Authorised Users) grants us and the Scalex Extended Family a worldwide, non-exclusive, limited term license to access, use, process, copy, distribute, perform, export and display Institute Admin Data, only as reasonably necessary (a) to provide, maintain and improve the Services; (b) to prevent or address service, security, support or technical issues; and (c) as expressly permitted by Institute Admin. Institute Admin represents and warrants that it has secured all rights in and to Institute Admin Data from its Authorised Users as may be necessary to grant this license.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>And What’s Ours is Ours</h3>

<p>We own and will continue to own our Services, including all related intellectual property rights. We may make software components available, via app stores or other channels, as part of the Services. We grant to Institute Admin a non-sub-licensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, limited license for Institute Admin and its Authorised Users to use the object code version of these components, but solely as necessary to use the Services and in accordance with the Contract and the User Terms. All of our rights not expressly granted by this license are hereby retained.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h2 lang="en-US" align="left">Term and Termination</h2>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Contract Term</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>As further described below, a paid subscription has a term that may expire or be terminated. The Contract remains effective until all subscriptions ordered under the Contract have expired or been terminated or the Contract itself terminates. Termination of the Contract will terminate all subscriptions and all Order Forms.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Auto-Renewal</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Unless an Order Form says something different, (a) all subscriptions automatically renew (without the need to go through the Services-interface “check-out” or execute a renewal Order Form) for additional periods equal to one (1) year or the preceding term, whichever is shorter; and (b) the per-unit pricing during any automatic renewal term will remain the same as it was during the immediately prior term. Either party can give the other notice of non-renewal at least ten (10) days before the end of a subscription term to stop the subscriptions from automatically renewing.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Termination for Cause</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>We or Institute Admin may terminate the Contract on notice to the other party if the other party materially breaches the Contract and such breach is not cured within ten (10) days after the non-breaching party provides notice of the breach. Institute Admin is responsible for its Authorised Users, including for any breaches of this Contract caused by its Authorised Users. We may terminate the Contract immediately on notice to Institute Admin if we reasonably believe that the Services are being used by Institute Admin or its Authorised Users in violation of applicable law.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Effect of Termination</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Upon any termination for cause by Institute Admin, we will refund Institute Admin any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all subscriptions after the effective date of termination. Upon any termination for cause by us, Institute Admin will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the term of those subscriptions after the effective date of termination. In no event will any termination relieve Institute Admin of the obligation to pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the effective date of termination.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Data Portability and Deletion</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>We are custodians of Institute Admin’s Data. During the term of subscriptions, Institute Admin will be permitted to export or share certain Institute Admin Data from the Services; provided, however, that because we have different products with varying features and Institute Admin has different retention options, Institute Admin acknowledges and agrees that the ability to export or share Institute Admin Data may be limited or unavailable depending on the type of Services plan in effect and the data retention, sharing or invite settings enabled. Following termination or expiration of subscriptions, we will have no obligation to maintain or provide any Institute Admin Data and may thereafter, unless legally prohibited, delete all Institute Admin Data in our systems or otherwise in our possession or under our control.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h2 lang="en-US" align="left">Representations; Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Institute Admin represents and warrants that it has validly entered into the Contract and has the legal power to do so. Institute Admin further represents and warrants that it is responsible for the conduct of its Authorised Users and their compliance with the terms of this Contract and the User Terms. Except as expressly provided for herein, the services and all related components and information are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis without any warranties of any kind, and we expressly disclaim any and all warranties, whether express or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability, title, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Institute Admin acknowledges that we do not warrant that the services will be in-interrupted, timely, secure or error-free.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h2 lang="en-US" align="left">Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Other than in connection with a party’s indemnification obligations hereunder, in no event will either institute admin’s or the scalex extended family’s aggregate liability arising out of or related to the contract or the User Terms (whether in contract or trot or under any other theory of liability) exceed the total amount paid by Institute Admin hereunder in the Twelve (12) months preceding the last event giving rise to the liability. The foregoing will not limit Institute Admin’s payment obligations under the “Payment Terms” section above.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>In no event will either Institute admin or any other member of the Scalex Extended family have any liability to the other party or to any third party for any lost profits or revenues or any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, cover or punitive damages however caused, whether or not the party has advised of the possibility of such damages. The forgoing disclaimer will not apply to the extent prohibited by the applicable law.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>The Institute Admin is responsible for all login credentials, including usernames and passwords, for administrator accounts as well the accounts of your Authorised Users. We will not be responsible for any damages, losses or liability to Institute Admin, Authorised Users, or anyone else, if such information is not kept confidential by Institute Admin or its Authorised Users, or if such information is correctly provided by an unauthorised third party logging into and accessing the Services.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>The limitations under this “Limitation of Liability” section apply with respect to all legal theories, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, and to the extent permitted by law. The provisions of this “Limitation of Liability” section allocate the risks under this Contract between the parties, and the parties have relied on these limitations in determining whether to enter into this Contract and the pricing for the Services.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h2 lang="en-US" align="left">Confidentiality</h2>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Confidential Information</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Each party (“Disclosing Party”) may disclose “Confidential Information” to the other party (“Receiving Party”) in connection with the Contract, which is anything that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure including all Order Forms, as well as non-public business, product, technology and marketing information. Confidential Information of Institute Admin includes Institute Admin Data. If something is labeled “Confidential,” that’s a clear indicator to the Receiving Party that the material is confidential. Notwithstanding the above, Confidential Information does not include information that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (b) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (c) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by the Receiving Party.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Protection and Use of Confidential Information</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>The Receiving Party will (a) take at least reasonable measures to prevent the unauthorised disclosure or use of Confidential Information, and limit access to those employees, affiliates and contractors who need to know such information in connection with the Contract ; and (b) not use or disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this Contract. Nothing above will prevent either party from sharing Confidential Information with financial and legal advisors; provided, however, that the advisors are bound to confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those in the Contract.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Compelled Access or Disclosure</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>The Receiving Party may access or disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is required by law; provided, however, that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled access or disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the access or disclosure.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h2 lang="en-US" align="left">General Provisions</h2>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Publicity</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Institute Admin grants us the right to use Institute Admin’s company name and logo as a reference for marketing or promotional purposes on our website and in other public or private communications with our existing or potential customers, subject to Institute Admin’s standard trademark usage guidelines as provided to us from time-to-time. We don’t want to list Institutes who don’t want to be listed, so Institute Admin may send us an email to support@scalex.systems stating that it does not wish to be used as a reference.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Force Majeure</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Neither us nor Institute Admin will be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations on account of events beyond the reasonable control of a party, which may include denial-of-service attacks, a failure by a third party hosting provider or utility provider, strikes, shortages, riots, fires, acts of God, war, terrorism, and governmental action.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Relationship</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>The parties are independent contractors. The Contract does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the parties. There are no third party beneficiaries to the Contract.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Email and Support Messages</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Except as otherwise set forth herein, all notices under the Contract will be by email, although we may instead choose to provide notice to Institute Admin through the Services (e.g., Zero Support notification). Notices to Scalex will be sent to support@scalex.systems, except for legal notices, such as notices of termination or an indemnifiable claim, which must be sent to legal@scalex.systems. Notices will be deemed to have been duly given (a) the day after it is sent, in the case of notices through email; and (b) the same day, in the case of notices through the Services.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Modifications</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>As our business evolves, we may change these Institute Admin Terms and the other components of the Contract (except subscription details). If we make a material change to the Contract, we will provide Institute Admin with reasonable notice prior to the change taking effect, either by emailing the email address associated with Institute Admin’s account or by messaging Institute Admin through the Services. Institute Admin can review the most current version of the Institute Admin Terms at any time by visiting this page and by visiting the most current versions of the other pages that are referenced in the Contract. The materially revised Contract will become effective on the date set forth in our notice, and all other changes will become effective upon posting of the change. If Institute Admin (or any Authorised User) accesses or uses the Services after the effective date, that use will constitute Institute Admin’s acceptance of any revised terms and conditions. </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>Governing Law</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>The Contract, and any disputes arising out of or related hereto, will be governed exclusively with the laws of the Republic of India.</p>
