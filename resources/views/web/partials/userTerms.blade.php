<h1>User Terms</h1>

<p><br />
</p>

<p class="small text-muted">Effective: Sunday, 5 March 2017</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>These User Terms of Service (the “User Terms”) govern your access and use of our online workplace productivity tools and platform (the “Services”). Please read them carefully. Even though you are signing onto an existing institute account, these User Terms apply to you —the prospective user reading these words. We are grateful you’re here.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>These User Terms are Legally Binding</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>These User Terms are a legally binding contract between you and us. If you access or use the Services, or continue accessing or using the Services after being notified of a change to the User Terms, you confirm that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by the User Terms. “We”, “our” and “us” currently refers to Scalex Systems Pvt. Ltd.</p>

<h2>Institute Admin Choices and Instructions</h2>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>You are an Authorised User on an Institute account Controlled by “Institute Admin”</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>An education institute administrator that we refer to in these User Terms as “Institute Admin” has invited you to an institute account (i.e., a unique domain where a group of users may access the Services).</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>What This Means for you—and for Us</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Institute Admin has separately agreed to our Institute Admin Terms of Service or entered into a written agreement with us (in either case, the “Contract”) that permitted Institute Admin to create and configure an institute account, so that you and others could join (each invitee granted access to the Services, including you, is an “Authorised User”). The Contract contains our commitment to deliver the Services to Institute Admin, who may then invite Authorised Users to join it’s account. When an Authorised User (including, you) submits personal content or information to the Services, such as messages and files (“User Data”) you acknowledge and agree that the User Data is owned by you. When an Authorised User (including, you) submits institute related content or information to the Services, such as personal information (“Institute Admin Data”) you acknowledge and agree that the Institute Admin Data is owned by Institute Admin and the Contract provides Institute Admin with many choices and control over that Institute Admin Data. For example, Institute Admin may provision or de-provision access to the Services, enable or disable third party integrations, manage permissions, retention and export settings, transfer or assign institute account, share courses, or consolidate institute account or institute courses with other institute account or courses.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>The Relationship Between You, Institute Admin and Us</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>As between us and Institute Admin, you agree that it is solely Institute Admin’s responsibility to (a) inform authorised users of any relevant Institute Admin’s policies and practices and any settings that may impact the processing of the Institute Admin’s data; (b) obtain any rights, permissions or consents from authorised users that are necessary for the lawful use of the Institute Admin’s data and the operation of the services; and (c) respond to and resolve any dispute with an authorised user relating to or based on Institute Admin’s data; the services or Institute Admin’s failure to fulfil these obligations or warranties of any kind, whether expressed or implied, to you relating to the services, which are provided to you on an “as is” and “as available” basis.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>You Must be Over the Age of 13</h3>

<p><a name="page2"></a> The Services are not intended for and should not be used by anyone under the age of thirteen. You represent that you are over the age of 13 and are the intended recipient of Institute Admin’s invitation to the Services. You may not access or use the Services for any purpose if either of the representations in the preceding sentence is not true.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h3>You Are Here At the Pleasure of Institute Admin (and Us)</h3>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>These User Terms remain effective until Institute Admin’s subscription for you expires or terminates, or your access to the Services has been terminated by Institute Admin or us. Please contact Institute Admin if you at any time or for any reason wish to terminate your account, including due to a disagreement with any updates to these User Terms.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>If we believe that there is a violation of the Contract, User Terms, or any of our other policies that can simply be remedied by Institute Admin’s removal of certain Institute Admin Data or taking other action, we will, in most cases, ask Institute Admin to take action rather than intervene. We may directly step in and take what we determine to be appropriate action (including disabling your account) if Institute Admin does not take appropriate action or we believe there is a credible risk of harm to us, the Services, Authorised Users, or any third parties. In no event will you or we have any liability to the other for any lost profits or revenues or any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, cover or punitive damages however caused, whether in contract, tort or under any other theory of liability, and whether or not the party has advised of the possibility of such damages. Unless you are also an Institute Admin (and without limitation to our rights and remedies under the contract), you will have no financial liability to us for a breach of these user terms. Our maximum aggregate liability to you for any breach of the user terms is Rupees Five thousand only (₹5000) in the aggregate. The forgoing disclaimers will not apply to the extent prohibited by the applicable law and do not limit either party’s right to seek and obtain equitable relief.</p>
